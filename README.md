# Power BI Project for Simulation Rule Formation

This GitHub repository houses a comprehensive Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize data from various simulation rule formation studies. It includes DAX and M code for statistical analyses, datasets, and interactive visualizations.

## Repository Structure

### Code
- **DAX Code**: Contains DAX scripts for calculating statistical measures such as the Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's d across different groups.
- **M Code**: M scripts for data preprocessing and transformations in Power BI.

### Data
- Includes CSV files (`data8.csv` and `data10.csv`) used for the analysis. These files contain structured data used to apply and visualize various statistical tests within the Power BI environment.

### Visuals
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visual representations that include interactive elements allowing users to explore data nuances more deeply.

The `Visuals` folder contains interactive dashboards that showcase the results of simulation rule formation studies under various conditions. These visuals help in understanding the impact and effectiveness of different rule application scenarios in educational and simulated environments.

### Results
- Contains a table displaying the results for the Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's d. These results detail the relationship between the variables 'Identify problem: goal stated' and 'Rule Current: Conservative Focusing' across the three experimental groups.
